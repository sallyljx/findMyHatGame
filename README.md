JavaScript assessment

1.)What did you like about this project?
We did not have to do the assessment from scratch, it's a fun project and my second game project which developed by using javaScript. 
More to come :)

My 1st Game : Guess My Num
My 2nd Game : Find My Hat

2.)What did you struggle with in this project?
Understanding of 2D array and class, and also how to move the the character with the keys. 

3.)What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Acting as a team project instead, open for team discussion and inputs. Integrated with HTML and CSS to styling the game for better look and layout
